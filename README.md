# homebrew-secureli

This repo contains the Homebrew formula for secureli. As part of the Alpha release, Homebrew is the package manager of choice that we wanted to support out of the gate
# Usage

To use this formula, please follow the steps below to add a private tap. You do need to be added to the Slalom Github organization before you can follow the steps below. This is due to the fact that a private tap is essentially doing a git clone of the repository

* brew tap  slalombuild/secureli https://github.com/slalombuild/homebrew-secureli.git
* brew install secureli

# Configuration

Once the package is installed, you can follow the standard configuration steps in the Secureli repository to init it against a repository and start using it!
 * TODO: Add link to secureli README once code is ported over
